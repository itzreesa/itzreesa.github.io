              okay so, here's my <a id="color-special-d" href="https://github.com/itzreesa">github</a>.
              </br>and also, my <a id="color-special-a"  href="https://itz-reesa.itch.io/">itch.io</a> since i've been focusing on game dev for a while now.
              </br></br>I've done a lot of different work, mainly: game dev, mobile app, desktop, web
              </br>Basically what I know: <strong><a id="color-special-e">Godot</a>(GDScript, C#), C, C++, C#, Flutter, JS(and some React), Java</strong> and recently I've tried to learn <a id="color-special-b">Rust</a> <small>[[REALLY FUN LANGUAGE]]</small></small>

              </br></br>I'll try to focus on game development for now, since it brings me the most joy.
              </br>And I feel pretty confident about it.
              </br> I have few ideas on what to do, the biggest hindrance for me is art tho.

              </br></br>I fucking looove Atlus gamesss!!
              </br></br>I randomly got introduced to Persona 5 Royal, and since then I fell in love with the series, going through:
              </br><strong>P5R, P3R, P4G, outside - Metaphor: ReFantazio and SMTV:V which I paused, because I got kinda bored heh</strong>
              </br></br>I am mainly interested in single player story games, and maybe co-op. I don't like it competetive that much, even though <strong>400h</strong> in r6 might suggest otherwise, <strong>except for overwatch, I love you, owerwath</strong>
              </br> Other notable entries: Genshin Impact - which is special to me, but I don't have interest in playing it rn... <small>boredddd</small> and apparently they are fwcking up linux players... great
              </br> and... <strong>DELTARUNE</strong> - love this fucking thing and whatever Toby Fox was<small>(is?)</small> on
